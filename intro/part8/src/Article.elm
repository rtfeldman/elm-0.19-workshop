  - Ways to access information about an article
  - Converting between various types

-- TYPES


{-| An article, optionally with an article body.

To see the difference between { extraInfo : a } and { extraInfo : Maybe Body },
consider the difference between the "view individual article" page (which
renders one article, including its body) and the "article feed" -
which displays multiple articles, but without bodies.

This definition for `Article` means we can write:

viewArticle : Article Full -> Html msg
viewFeed : List (Article Preview) -> Html msg

This indicates that `viewArticle` requires an article _with a `body` present_,
wereas `viewFeed` accepts articles with no bodies. (We could also have written
it as `List (Article a)` to specify that feeds can accept either articles that
have `body` present or not. Either work, given that feeds do not attempt to
read the `body` field from articles.)

This is an important distinction, because in Request.Article, the `feed`
function produces `List (Article Preview)` because the API does not return bodies.
Those articles are useful to the feed, but not to the individual article view.

-- TRANSFORM


{-| This is the only way you can transform an existing article:
you can change its author (e.g. to follow or unfollow them).
All other article data necessarily comes from the server!

We can tell this for sure by looking at the types of the exposed functions
in this module.
